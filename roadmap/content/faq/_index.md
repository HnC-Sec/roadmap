## "Hacking" Questions

### My (Youtube/Insta/Discord/Email) account was hacked. How can I hack it back?

This is probably the single most common question we see in the server.

**Short answer**: You can't. Contact support for whatever service the account was with, and often they can help you recover a hacked account.

> [!CAUTION]
> There absolutely will be people who tell you that they can hack your account back for you. It is 100% guaranteed they are scammers. Do not trust them. Do not give them information. Definitely do not give them money.

**Long Answer**: Most likely, the way the attacker gained access to your account was either through phishing (you clicked a link that took you to a fake login page and gave them your credentials), or through leaked password data (you used the same password on multiple accounts, and one of them had a data breach that leaked the password). This method isn't going to work to get your account back, because the people who have it now aren't going to fall for it.

Any attempt to get the account back through trying to "hack" it back (Hacking the database and changing the password, hacking the people who took the account, etc) is going to be highly illegal, and most likely will end up with you being charged with computer crimes, and being banned from the service entirely for life. 

It should also be mentioned that these companies (Google, Meta, Roblox, etc) are spending millions of dollars a year making sure their services aren't able to be hacked like this. It's a near impossibility that anyone outside of heavily funded, state-sponsored hacking groups would be able to  get in and achieve what you are asking someone to do.



## Programming Questions

### What programming language should I learn?
### What is the best programming language?

There isn't really a universal answer to these questions. If there were one "best" programming language, we wouldn't have hundreds of them. Often times, the choice of what programming language to use comes down to factors like what goal you are trying to achieve, what hardware/software the program is running on, what language others in that field are using, and usually the biggest factor is personal preference.

Most programming languages are capable of doing almost any task. Some are better suited for some tasks, but almost universally lanaguages are capable of completing any task you want, with enough effort. For example, you can write a back-end webserver in C, C++, C#, Python, or any other language. In C it might be 10,000 lines of code, while in Python it might be 10 lines. 

Generally it is recommended that, unless you have a specific goal in mind that makes one language better than another, you start off learning one of the major, general purpose lanauges. Most often the recommendation is something like Python, Javascript, or Java, as those are a good middle ground between being commonly used, and being easy for beginners to learn. All of them will teach you the basics of programming as you learn.

Once you have a good handle on the basics, you can start to branch out to other languages either as needs for them arise, or your curiosity drives you to them. With few exceptions, the basic concepts from one language will still apply to other languages. As you grow and learn more, you will find that picking up a new language becomes fairly simple, as you are just writing the same logical flow of events, just with different syntax and layouts.
