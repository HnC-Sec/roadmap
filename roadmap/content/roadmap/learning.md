This section could probably be titled "Learning to Learn", but whatever you call it, it is a critical first step on our journey. In today's world, we are constantly bombarded with information from a variety of sources. It can be difficult to know what information is reliable and what information is not. Learning how to research and learn independently is essential for making informed decisions in all areas of our lives. When it comes to the world of computer security, this is especially important, as many of the things you may end up researching will be topics where the differentiation between "ethical" and "unethical" come down to how the information is applied. It is usually safe to assume that if someone is willing to write information about how to perform potentially unethical tasks, they are probably willing to do unethical things like embedding malicious commands in something that users might copy/paste and execute on their own system.

## How to Find Reliable Resources

The first step in conducting research is to find reliable resources. There are many different types of resources available, including books, articles, websites, and videos. When evaluating a resource, it is important to consider the following factors:

- The author's credentials: Is the author an expert in the field?
- The publisher's reputation: Is the publisher known for publishing accurate and reliable information?
- The date of publication: Is the information appropriately up to date for your purposes?
- The purpose of the resource: Is the resource intended to inform or persuade?

It is also helpful at times to search in specific areas, or with specific guidelines in place to try and get the kind of information you are looking for. For example, well understood topics that have been thoroughly documented and researched will typically be easy to find reliable and accurate information about when doing a basic Google search. On the other hand, topics that are at the forefront of technology and science will tend to have a much higher level of unsupported speculation and blatantly false information on the wider internet. In these cases, it can be helpful to constrain your search to academic and industry journals, where information will typically be better reviewed by multiple experts. Google provides the wonderful Google Scholar search engine (https://scholar.google.com) which limits search results to only scholarly articles that are usually very clear about things like their bias and level of knowledge.

Many times when searching for resources, you might find that changing the terms you are using for a subject can drastically influence the quality of the returned results. For example, when searching for information about computer security, you can search for it as "computer security", "infosec", or "hacking". The first two terms will bring you results that are typically written by professionals, with the aim of helping to instruct other professionals. On the other hand, "hacking" will tend towards results with clickbait titles, designed to drive revenue for a content farm, or drive views on services like Youtube.

The term "clickbait" typically refers to articles and videos with titles and previews designed to be overly dramatic, leading to users being more likely to click on the page, even if the information isn't really all that dramatic or interesting. Content farms are groups that latch on to popular terms (for example "hacking"), and generate money by creating massive quantities of low-quality content purely for the purpose of trying to get users to click on them before realizing they have very little actual useful content.

## How to Evaluate a Source

Once you have found a variety of resources, you need to evaluate them to determine which ones are reliable. Here are some tips for evaluating a source:

Look for evidence to support the author's claims. Does the author cite sources to support their claims? Usually in the world of computers, this will be a link to documentation or sometimes even to source code.

Be aware of bias. Is the author trying to persuade you to adopt a particular point of view?

Be critical of the information. Don't just accept everything you read at face value. Ask yourself if the information makes sense and if it is consistent with other things you know.

## How to Ask Good Questions

When you are learning and run into something you can't figure out or don't understand, it is important to ask good questions. This will help you to gather the information you need and to evaluate the reliability of your sources. Here are some tips for asking good questions:

- Ask open-ended questions. These are questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.
- Ask specific questions. These are questions that focus on a particular topic or issue.
- Ask probing questions. These are questions that ask for more information or clarification.

**Bad Questions**

- Can someone help me?
- Does anyone here know Python?
- What things should I learn?

**Good Questions**

- When I run `<command>` I get `<error>`, why?
- I want to learn more about Cryptography, what are some good resources?
- I understand you recommend PyCharm over Visual Studio Code, are there specific reasons?

## The XY Problem

One common thing that can happen when asking questions is what is known as the XY Problem. This refers to a situation where, because users are tightly focused on their specific situation, they will ask about their attempted solution, rather than the actual problem. An example might be: You are writing a script and need to get the extension from a filename. You decide that you are going to achieve this by just taking the last 3 characters from a filename, but now you have to worry about extensions with 4 letters, or files without an extension, or extensions like .tar.gz with two.

Having decided to just make a bunch of code that handles all the situations, you start asking questions like "How do I get only the last 3 characters of a string?", "How do I count the number of characters after a dot in a string?", or "How do I check if a string has a dot in it?". These are all fine questions on their own, but if you were to elaborate slightly and say "I am attempting to get the extension from a filename in my script. How can I get the last 3 characters of a string?", that allows for the opportunity for a kind expert to step in and point you to methods that already exist in the language to handle "getting the extension for a filename". Always try to provide some additional context around your questions, and if someone asks for more information around the circumstances of your question, see where they are going. If there are other solutions you've already ruled out, share why you've ruled them out. This gives more information about your requirements.

## How to Identify Bias

Bias is prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair. In the world of technology, this commonly happens when people have strong opinions on a specific topic, such as which operating system is better. It is important to be able to identify bias when you are conducting research. Be aware of the different types of bias. There are many different types of bias, including confirmation bias, selection bias, and observer bias.

**Tips for identifying bias:**
- Check if the author presents only one side of an argument or ignores counter-evidence.
- Notice if the source relies heavily on anecdotal evidence instead of data or research.
- Evaluate whether the author has a financial or personal stake in the topic.
- Look for emotionally charged or sensational language that may sway opinion.
- Assess if the source uses broad generalizations or stereotypes without supporting facts.

## How to Identify Scams

Scams are designed to trick you into giving away money, personal information, or access to your accounts. They often appear legitimate at first glance, but there are usually warning signs if you look closely. When evaluating a resource or offer, always take a moment to consider whether it could be a scam. Be wary of resources that are trying to sell you something. Scammers often use persuasive language and make promises that seem too good to be true.

**Signs something might be a scam:**
- Promises of guaranteed results or "too good to be true" offers
- Requests for payment or sensitive information upfront
- Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or unprofessional website design
- Pressure to act quickly or threats of negative consequences if you don't comply
- Lack of verifiable contact information or a suspicious-looking website URL

## Using AI for learning

In today's world, AI is being touted as the solution to every problem, including making learning easier. When used correctly, AI can be incredibly helpful. For example, much of the basic structure of this document was written by Google's Bard AI. What you need to be careful of when utilizing AI is the very fine distinction between "Correct information" and "Information that looks correct". By their nature, AI models are trained to generate information that looks correct. In many cases, this can overlap with actual correct information, but in other cases where the source data may not be as clear, AI models will tend towards making up information that looks correct, rather than returning an answer like "I don't know, ask someone else."

One common example of this issue is when attempting to use AI models for generating source code. Many times when generating code in languages like Python, AI models will import common modules and use functions or classes from them. In cases where AI models are asked to generate code for something that they haven't been trained on, they will follow their training and return an answer that "looks correct", many times including modules that sound like they should be real, calling functions that match common naming patters, but that in reality do not exist. When this occurs, it is commonly known as an AI hallucination.

## Conclusion

Learning how to research and learn independently is an essential skill for everyone. It will help you to make informed decisions in all areas of your life. By following the tips above, you can find reliable resources, evaluate sources, ask good questions, and identify bias and scams. As you progress through your learning, you will find that researching is a skill like any other. If you continue to exercise it and train it, you will see improvement in how long it takes to find resources, and how quickly you are able to assess them.

## Research Tips

- Use multiple sources. Don't rely on just one source for information. Try to find multiple sources that corroborate each other.
- Be patient. Research can be time-consuming. Don't expect to find all the information you need right away.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you are struggling to find information or to evaluate a source, ask for help.
