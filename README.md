## Working with Hugo

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go.

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (extended version recommended)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (for theme modules)

### Using the Development Container (Recommended)

This repository includes a preconfigured development container that provides everything you need to work with the site without installing dependencies locally.

**Requirements:**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the repository in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. The container will automatically build with:
   - Go 1.24 (Debian Bookworm base)
   - Hugo (latest version)
   - Git and common development tools
   - All necessary dependencies preconfigured

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Consistent development environment across all machines
- âœ… No need to install Hugo, Go, or other dependencies locally
- âœ… Isolated environment that doesn't affect your local system
- âœ… Pre-configured with all necessary tools and extensions

### Building and Testing

To work with the site locally:

1. **Navigate to the Hugo directory:**
   ```bash
   cd roadmap/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   hugo mod tidy
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 1313
   ```
   The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`

### Adding Content

- Create new pages using Hugo archetypes: `hugo new content/section/page.md`
- Edit existing content in the `content/` directory
- Static assets go in the `content/images/` directory

## Theme and Documentation

This site uses the **Hextra** theme, a modern and feature-rich Hugo theme designed for documentation sites.
